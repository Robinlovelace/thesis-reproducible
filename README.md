# Reproducible thesis results

The aim of this repository is to make some of the methods of my PhD accessible to as many people as possible.
The final thesis is a rather large (20 Mb) file with many figures. It can be downloaded from here:  http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/5027/

A smaller one, containing just the text is available here: https://github.com/Robinlovelace/thesis-reproducible/raw/master/Thesis-no-figs.pdf 

The scripts are written in R, a free and open souce language that runs on any major desktop operating system. 
If you have any issues with the input data or making the code run, please contact me. Rob 00 x at gmail. com.
