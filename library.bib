@article{Saito1992,
abstract = {The interregional cohort survival model developed by Rogers is an excellent one that includes all of the three population processes: birth - death, aging, and interregional migration. Rogers's model, however, has been rarely implemented because it requires detailed data concerning cohortwise (that is by age and sex) interregional migration tables which are not usually available as published data. The most usual case is that only marginal tables that are from different sources can be obtained. However, in this case, those marginal tables necessarily show inconsistency in the sense that they do not have identical common submarginals. This inconsistency prevents the standard iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure from converging to the estimate of the complete migration table which conforms to the given observed marginals. Thus to implement Rogers's model some method is needed to estimate the complete migration table where only inconsistent marginals are available. In this paper a multistep IPF procedure is proposed for that purpose and an actual application of the proposed method is shown. The multistep IPF procedure has universal applicability to a wide class of general problems concerned with the estimation of a joint table under inconsistent marginals.},

@article{Denholm2009,
abstract = {The electric power system in the Western United States was simulated to evaluate the potential of solar photovoltaics (PV) in reducing fossil-fuel use and associated emissions. The simulations used a utility production cost model to evaluate a series of PV penetrations where up to 10\% of the region's electricity is derived from PV. The analysis focused on California, which uses gas for a large fraction of its generation and Colorado, which derives most of its electricity from coal. PV displaces gas and electricity imports almost exclusively in California, with a displacement rate of about 6000-9000 kJ per kWh of PV energy generated. In Colorado, PV offsets mostly gas at low penetration, with increasing coal displacement during nonsummer months and at higher penetration. Associated reductions in CO2, NOx, and SO2 emissions are also calculated.},

abstract = {Global Ecologyargues that the magnitude and speed of global environmental change poses a threat for the continuation of life on this planet. Many aspects of this crisis are all too familiar to us: the destruction of tropical rainforests, the hole in the Antarctic ozone layer, desertification, and soil erosion. Yet we avoid the underlying challenge of a rapidly deteriorating ecological system and the breadth and complexity of the response that is required. Vaclav Smil evaluates the current state of knowledge concerning atmospheric change. Recognizing the limits of scientific studies and quantitative modeling, Smil analyzes the weaknesses and uncertainties of our environmental understanding and provides a discussion of the levels of food, energy, water and materials necessary to support a decent quality of life. This timely and crucial study explores the promises and problems of different paths towards global management. With a focus on the importance of flexibleresponse, it provides an analysis of both social and environmental needs. It will further our understanding of biospheric change and of our abilities and weaknesses in managing the transition to a sustainable society.},

@article{Graetz1993,
abstract = {This study examines the impact of employment and unemployment on psychological health and well-being, as measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Using longitudinal data, it traces health changes over time for a variety of groups and through a variety of labour market experiences: during sustained employment and unemployment, in the transition from school to employment and unemployment, and as people move between employment and unemployment and between satisfying and unsatisfying jobs. The results show that employed people report significantly lower levels of health disorder than students and the unemployed. These differences are largely unaffected by demographic attributes, living arrangements, socioeconomic status or immediate labour market experiences, and can be attributed to employment status itself rather than predisposing health differences. However, the health consequences of employment and unemployment are directly contingent upon quality of work. As a result, the highest levels of health risk are found amongst dissatisfied workers and the lowest levels amongst satisfied workers. In between these two extremes lie employed people neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with their jobs, unemployed people irrespective of duration, and students. These results indicate that what happens in the workplace has even more impact on a person's health than success or failure in finding a job and keeping it.},

abstract = {One of the objectives of designing feature selection learning algorithms is to obtain classifiers that depend on a small number of attributes and have verifiable future performance guarantees. There are few, if any, approaches that successfully address the two goals simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, such algorithms that give theoretical bounds on the future performance have not been proposed so far in the context of the classification of gene expression data. In this work, we investigate the premise of learning a conjunction (or disjunction) of decision stumps in Occam's Razor, Sample Compression, and PAC-Bayes learning settings for identifying a small subset of attributes that can be used to perform reliable classification tasks. We apply the proposed approaches for gene identification from DNA microarray data and compare our results to those of the well known successful approaches proposed for the task. We show that our algorithm not only finds hypotheses with much smaller number of genes while giving competitive classification accuracy but also have tight risk guarantees on future performance unlike other approaches. The proposed approaches are general and extensible in terms of both designing novel algorithms and application to other domains.},

Intended to raise their awareness and real understanding of the contribution of renewable energy technologies to everyday life, the programme has a further objective to expand the experience of local construction professionals in RET installations. At the same time the programme aims to create the start-up market for new industries specialising in related technology components, boosting their commercialisation and reducing costs plus reviving HK's industry sector. It's ultimate goal is to reduce CO2 emissions through setting the school target of 25\% energy generation from RET technologies. BIPV installations are the initial technology. These are combined with a specially developed school BEMS and website-based monitoring system from which the first pilot school will be assessed. Mini-installations are to be funded and installed in all HK schools through the HK PV Consortium.},

Models are developed to relate trip-chaining patterns to three types of factors: ( a ) socioeconomic characteristics, ( b ) workplace conditions, and ( c ) traffic system characteristics. The analysis is based on a diary survey of commuters in Dallas, Texas. The transferability of commuter trip-chaining behavior is also examined through comparison with results of a previous study conducted in Austin, Texas. Commuters engaged in many nonwork stops during commuting trips, indicating that trip chaining is an essential characteristic of commuting behavior. The analysis reveals that socioeconomic attributes, workplace conditions, and commuter preference exert similar influences in the two cities, whereas traffic system characteristics (namely, no-stop travel time) have different influences on morning stop frequency behavior in the two cities. For the evening, no attributes were found to have significantly different effects between Austin and Dallas.},

In contrast, biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on degraded and abandoned agricultural lands planted with perennials incur little or no carbon debt and can offer immediate and sustained GHG advantages.},

Warming and drying trends are likely to induce substantial species-range shifts, and imply a need for migration rates that will exceed the capacity of many endemic species. Land use, habitat fragmentation and intense human pressures will further limit natural adaptation responses, and fire-regime shifts may threaten specific species and plant functional types. Vegetation structural change driven by dominant, common or invasive species may also threaten rare species. Overall, a loss of biodiversity and carbon sequestration services may be realised over much of these regions.},

This paper considers, from an economic viewpoint, whether multiple inverter systems can ever be justified for PV systems <5 kWp, under the conditions that presently exist in the UK. The UK scenario being one of very high labour costs combined with both relatively low radiation levels and feed in tariffs. Analysis of a 7.2 kWp test fa\c{c}ade configured with string and central inverters indicates that the mismatch reductions that can be achieved do not compensate for the additional capital cost of a multiple inverter installation. In addition, unless the mean time to failure of inverters approaches that of the 25 year lifetime of the dc side of the PV system, the economics of small scale grid connected PV in the UK will remain difficult, even when the cost of the PV component falls.},

@book{Gilbert2008a,
abstract = {The lives of people around the world, particularly in developed countries, depend on relatively inexpensive movement of people and goods. Now, more than ever, the prospect of rising costs puts continuation of this transport dependence in question. Costs could rise significantly due to the needs to reduce pollution, reverse urban sprawl, enhance security and, above all, use fuel that will become dramatically more expensive than those used now. This book sets out the challenges that will soon threaten modern society's dependence on low-cost transport in the light of the problems posed by oil supply and climate change. It proposes organizational and technical innovations that could ensure effective, secure movement of people and goods in ways that minimize environmental impacts and make the best use of renewable sources of energy. The authors conclude that transport in the first half of the 21st century will feature at least two revolutions. One will involve the use of electric drives rather than internal combustion engines. The other will involve powering these drives directly from the electric grid rather than from on-board fuel. The authors also address revolutions in marine transport and aviation and analyze the politics and business of transport and how these will undergo profound change in the decades ahead. This fresh look at the topic offers explanations, challenges the failures of governments and industry and proposes strategies and actions that can move transport towards sustainability.},

abstract = {We aim to generate virtual commuting networks in the French rural regions in order to study the dynamics of their municipalities. Since we have to model small commuting flows between municipalities with a few hundreds or thousands inhabitants, we opt for a stochastic model presented by Gargiulo et al. 2012. It reproduces the various possible complete networks using an iterative process, stochastically choosing a workplace in the region for each commuter living in the municipality of a region. The choice is made considering the job offers in each municipality of the region and the distance to all the possible destinations. This paper presents how to adapt and implement this model to generate French regions commuting networks between municipalities. We address three different questions: How to generate a reliable virtual commuting network for a region highly dependant of other regions for the satisfaction of its resident's demand for employment? What about a convenient deterrence function? How to calibrate the model when detailed data is not available? We answer proposing an extended job search geographical base for commuters living in the municipalities, we compare two different deterrence functions and we show that the parameter is a constant for network linking French municipalities.},

@book{Robert2009,
abstract = {Computational techniques based on simulation have now become an essential part of the statistician's toolbox. It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer's point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here. This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader.},

@book{Jahoda1982,
abstract = {This book was first published in 1982. Unemployment is perhaps one of the most serious social problems. In economic terms the cost of unemployment, both to the individual and to the collective, is extremely high. But unemployment has other effects too. In this book Marie Jahoda looks beyond the obvious economic consequences, to explore the psychological meaning of employment and unemployment. The book is an accessible and nontechnical account of the contribution which social psychology can make to understanding unemployment and clearly reveals the limitations of an exclusive concentration on its economic aspects. Professor Jahoda shows that the psychological impact is hugely destructive, throwing doubt on the popular diagnosis that the work ethic is disappearing. She also analyses the experience of unemployment in the context of the experience of employment and argues that one of the socially destructive consequences of large-scale unemployment is that it detracts from the need to humanise employment.},

@article{Woodcock2007,
abstract = {We examine the links between fossil-fuel-based transportation, greenhouse-gas emissions, and health. Transport-related carbon emissions are rising and there is increasing consensus that the growth in motorised land vehicles and aviation is incompatible with averting serious climate change. The energy intensity of land transport correlates with its adverse health effects. Adverse health effects occur through climate change, road-traffic injuries, physical inactivity, urban air pollution, energy-related conflict, and environmental degradation. For the world's poor people, walking is the main mode of transport, but such populations often experience the most from the harms of energy-intensive transport. New energy sources and improvements in vehicle design and in information technology are necessary but not sufficient to reduce transport-related carbon emissions without accompanying behavioural change. By contrast, active transport has the potential to improve health and equity, and reduce emissions. Cities require safe and pleasant environments for active transport with destinations in easy reach and, for longer journeys, public transport that is powered by renewable energy, thus providing high levels of accessibility without car use. Much investment in major road projects does not meet the transport needs of poor people, especially women whose trips are primarily local and off road. Sustainable development is better promoted through improving walking and cycling infrastructures, increasing access to cycles, and investment in transport services for essential needs. Our model of London shows how increased active transport could help achieve substantial reductions in emissions by 2030 while improving population health. There exists the potential for a global contraction and convergence in use of fossil-fuel energy for transport to benefit health and achieve sustainability.},

abstract = {A new method for the discrimination of varieties of corn was proposed based on the data set of near-infrared spectroscopy range from 4 000 to 12 000 cm(-1) of corn seed varieties. Principal component analysis (PCA) method was used to study the feature of the data, and the authors found that the near-infrared spectroscopy of corn seed varieties has a clear feature of zonal distribution, so the correlativity between the change in the distribution of the principal component and the discrimination result was studied, according to which the normalized principal component analysis (NPCA) method was proposed. Besides, principal direction biomimetic pattern recognition (PBPR) was proposed according to the feature, which got a better discrimination result. The average correct recognition rate attained 97.67\% for test set I, and the average correct rejection rate attained 98.40\%, with 13 of the 30 varieties reaching the correct recognition rate of 100\%; The average correct rejection rate attained 98.90\% for the test set II , and 11 of the 30 varieties reached the correct rejection rate of 100\%. It was proved that the method had a high correct discrimination rate.},

abstract = {Research in transportation, urban design, and planning has examined associations between physical environment variables and individuals' walking and cycling for transport. Constructs, methods, and findings from these fields can be applied by physical activity and health researchers to improve understanding of environmental influences on physical activity. In this review, neighborhood environment characteristics proposed to be relevant to walking/cycling for transport are defined, including population density, connectivity, and land use mix. Neighborhood comparison and correlational studies with nonmotorized transport outcomes are considered, with evidence suggesting that residents from communities with higher density, greater connectivity, and more land use mix report higher rates of walking/cycling for utilitarian purposes than low-density, poorly connected, and single land use neighborhoods. Environmental variables appear to add to variance accounted for beyond sociodemographic predictors of walking/cycling for transport. Implications of the transportation literature for physical activity and related research are outlined. Future research directions are detailed for physical activity research to further examine the impact of neighborhood and other physical environment factors on physical activity and the potential interactive effects of psychosocial and environmental variables. The transportation, urban design, and planning literatures provide a valuable starting point for multidisciplinary research on environmental contributions to physical activity levels in the population.},

Recent studies reveal the complexity of organizational, spatial, and temporal couplings of CHANS. These couplings have evolved from direct to more indirect interactions, from adjacent to more distant linkages, from local to global scales, and from simple to complex patterns and processes. Untangling complexities, such as reciprocal effects and emergent properties, can lead to novel scientific discoveries and is essential to developing effective policies for ecological and socioeconomic sustainability. Opportunities for truly integrating various disciplines are emerging to address fundamental questions about CHANS and meet society's unprecedented challenges.},

abstract = {Summary The article presents a commercial investment analysis of the carbon capture project at the K\aa rst\o gas processing plant in south-western Norway. We update an earlier analysis and critically review the methods used--including those applied for cost estimating. Our conclusion is that carbon capture and storage (CCS) at K\aa rst\o would be a very unprofitable climate measure with poor cost efficiency. It would require more than USD 1.7 billion1 in subsidies, or in excess of USD 133 million per year. That corresponds to a subsidy of roughly USD 0.1 per kWh on the power station's electricity output. The cost per tonne of carbon emissions abated is about USD 333, which is about 20 times the international carbon emission allowance price and many times higher than alternative domestic climate measures.},

abstract = {Increased cycling as a means of personal travel could generate environmental
benefits if associated with a corresponding decrease in car-based
transport. For promoting cycling during winter, the maintenance service
level of cycleways is of importance. Earlier studies indicated that
the Swedish public is unsatisfied with the service levels provided
on cycleways during winter. In Sweden, cycleways normally are cleared
of snow through plowing and are gritted for skid control. Field studies
tested an unconventional winter maintenance method that uses a power
broom for snow clearance and salt for deicing. The field studies
were evaluated through road-condition observations, measurements
of friction, a questionnaire survey, interviews, and bicycle measurements.
The method of using a power. broom for snow clearance and salt for
deicing provided a higher service level than traditional winter maintenance
methods, but it was two to three times more expensive. The method
has greater potential in regions, such as southern Sweden, with low
snow accumulations but with major ice-formation problems than in
regions with a colder climate. Cyclists noticed. the improved maintenance
service level provided with the method used in the field study, but
although cyclists stated that road condition is important to their
decision to cycle, it could not be concluded that the enhanced service
level generated a higher winter cycling frequency.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives Previous studies have shown substantial geographical variation in blood donation within developed countries. To understand this issue better, we identified community characteristics associated with blood donor rates in German municipalities in an ecological analysis. Materials and Methods We calculated an aggregated rate of voluntary blood donors from each of 1533 municipalities in south-west Germany in 2007 from a database of the German Red Cross Blood Service. A multiple linear regression model estimated the association between the municipality-specific donor rate and several community characteristics. Finally, a spatial lag regression model was used to control for spatial autocorrelation that occurs when neighbouring units are related to each other. Results The spatial lag regression model showed that a relatively larger population, a higher percentage of inhabitants older than 30years, a higher percentage of non-German citizens and a higher percentage of unemployed persons were associated with lower municipality-specific donor rates. Conversely, a higher donor rate was correlated with higher voter turnout, a higher percentage of inhabitants between 18 and 24years and more frequent mobile donation sites. Conclusions Blood donation appears to be a highly clustered regional phenomenon, suggesting the need for regionally targeted recruiting efforts and careful consideration of the value of mobile donation sites. Our model further suggests that municipalities with a decreasing percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds and an increasing percentage of older inhabitants may experience substantial declines in future blood donations.},

In the form of this compact volume, one of the best and most productive peak oil authors working today has turned his customary scholarhsip, wisdom, wit and writing prowess to some of the most ciritical issues now unfolding on our planet. "- Frank Kaminski, Energy Bulletin Coal fuels about 50\% of US electricity production and provides a quarter of the country's total energy. China and India's ferocious economic growth is based on coal-generated electricity. Coal currently looks like a solution to many of our fast-growing energy problems. However, while coal advocates are urging full steam ahead, increasing reliance on the dirtiest of all fossil fuels has crucial implications for climate science, energy policy, the world economy, and geopolitics. Drawbacks to a coal-based energy strategy include: Blackoutgoes to the heart of the tough energy questions that will dominate every sphere of public policy throughout the first half of this century, and it is a must-read for planners, educators, and anyone concerned about energy consumption, peak oil, and climate change.

abstract = {We consider several ways in which a good understanding of modern techniques and principles in physics can elucidate ecology, and we focus on analogical reasoning between these two branches of science. Analogical reasoning requires an understanding of both sciences and an appreciation of the similarities and points of contact between the two. In the current ecological literature on the relationship between ecology and physics, there has been some misunderstanding about the nature of modern physics and its methods. Physics is seen as being much cleaner and tidier than ecology. When compared to this idealized, fictional version of physics, ecology looks very different, and the prospect of ecology and physics learning from one another is questionable. We argue that physics, once properly understood, is more like ecology than ecologists have thus far appreciated. Physicists and ecologists can and do learn from each other, and, in this paper, we outline how analogical reasoning can facilitate such exchanges.},

abstract = {The relationship between the demographic attributes and spatial clustering of individuals making a weekday bicycle journey-to-work commute and their commuting travel time is explored. The study uses data from a 1993 bicycle-intercept survey distributed in Seattle, Washington, in which individual bicycle-travel behavior characteristics were collected. The data include socioeconomic information, such as age, gender and income. The results indicate that these three factors may play unexpected roles in the length of bicycle commuting travel times for the journey-to-work trips. This study also suggests that separated bicycle paths play an integral part in the overall bicycle transportation network. Statistical analysis also indicated that cyclists traveling primarily on separated paths tend to make significantly longer trips.},

Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the association between the outcome and sociodemographic, occupational and behavioral variables. The main form of commuting to and from work was by bus (45.7\%). Workers with higher socioeconomic condition were more likely to engage in passive commuting.},

abstract = {The replication of important findings by multiple independent investigators is fundamental to the accumulation of scientific evidence. Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.},

@article{Layton2008,
abstract = {We present a "Bicycle Highway" transportation alternative to automobile
commuting by exploring avenues for reducing perceived impediments
to bicycle commuting. The three primary goals of the project are:
1) Address the American diabetes and obesity epidemics by making
exercising on a daily basis a more desirable and viable alternative.
2) Address the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants
by partially replacing combustion engines with human-powered transportation.
3) Address the problem of the United States' dependence on foreign
oil by diminishing energy demand for short-range transportation.
The primary variables we will consider are N, the number of people
being transported, d, the distance being traveled, C, the energy
cost required to travel the distance, and t, the time required to
travel the distance. The Bicycle Highway was found to have a poorer
throughput rating when only construction costs were considered, but
a better throughput rating when vehicle and fuel costs are introduced.
The Bicycle Highway offers a timely and economical solution to the
numerous side-effects of the century-long success of the gasoline-powered
automobile. A transportation corridor that is designated solely for
bicyclists, human-electric hybrid and zero-emission vehicles, would
allow for a greater volume of commuter traffic with minimal energetic
and entropic impact. This proposed roadway promises to make bicycle
travel much safer and will alleviate frustration felt by motorists
sharing the road with bicycles. We expect cost-effectiveness of our
design to be enhanced further if reductions in obesity, asthma, and
lung-disease related costs are considered in future case studies.},

@article{Trainer2010,
abstract = {Virtually all current discussion of climate change and energy problems proceeds on the assumption that technical solutions are possible within basically affluent-consumer societies. There is however a substantial case that this assumption is mistaken. This case derives from a consideration of the scale of the tasks and of the limits of non-carbon energy sources, focusing especially on the need for redundant capacity in winter. The first line of argument is to do with the extremely high capital cost of the supply system that would be required, and the second is to do with the problems set by the intermittency of renewable sources. It is concluded that the general climate change and energy problem cannot be solved without large scale reductions in rates of economic production and consumption, and therefore without transition to fundamentally different social structures and systems.},

[t]his book can be very highly recommended." —Short Book Reviews "Of great interest to potential readers is the variety of fields that are represented in the examples: health care, financial, government, product marketing, and sports, to name a few." —Journal of Quality Technology "Alan Agresti has written another brilliant account of the analysis of categorical data." —The Statistician The use of statistical methods for categorical data is ever increasing in today's world. An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, Second Edition provides an applied introduction to the most important methods for analyzing categorical data. This new edition summarizes methods that have long played a prominent role in data analysis, such as chi-squared tests, and also places special emphasis on logistic regression and other modeling techniques for univariate and correlated multivariate categorical responses. This Second Edition features: Two new chapters on the methods for clustered data, with an emphasis on generalized estimating equations (GEE) and random effects models A unified perspective based on generalized linear models An emphasis on logistic regression modeling An appendix that demonstrates the use of SAS® for all methods An entertaining historical perspective on the development of the methods Specialized methods for ordinal data, small samples, multicategory data, and matched pairs More than 100 analyses of real data sets and nearly 300 exercises Written in an applied, nontechnical style, the book illustrates methods using a wide variety of real data, including medical clinical trials, drug use by teenagers, basketball shooting, horseshoe crab mating, environmental opinions, correlates of happiness, and much more. An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, Second Edition is an invaluable tool for social, behavioral, and biomedical scientists, as well as researchers in public health, marketing, education, biological and agricultural sciences, and industrial quality control.},

abstract = {Appraisal -- defined here to include a variety of ex ante techniques and procedures that seek to predict and evaluate the consequences of certain human actions -- has been afforded an increasingly important role in environmental policy. We argue in this paper, however, that both the nature of appraisal and its role in the political process have been inadequately conceptualised. Exploring a literature that has tended to polarise 'technical' and 'deliberative' models, we identify a need for sensitive selection and combination of approaches, taking account of both the object and the objective of appraisal in particular contexts. We suggest that an important role for appraisal (by design or by default) may be that of providing spaces for dialogue and learning in the making of policies and decisions. A better understanding of such processes requires further research, particularly well-designed longitudinal work involving retrospective and 'real time' studies of appraisal in practice.},

abstract = {Intersectoral health policy implies negotiations with politicians outside the health sector. Health politicians have a stronger position if they can quantify health impact. In this Dutch case-study we used a computer simulation approach to answer the following questions: Which anti-tobacco intervention has the largest health gain? Will a commuter cycling policy result in any substantial health gain? What is the relative health gain of promoting higher consumption of vegetables and fruit? We concluded that substantial health gain can be achieved if cigarette packet price were to increase by 2 Dutch guilders. A commitment of all general practitioners to implement a smoking cessation intervention will result in a similar health gain. Stimulating commuter cycling could be a promising example of intersectoral health policy. Interventions to promote higher vegetable and fruit consumption will result in a relatively small health gain. Pros and cons of simulation models to support intersectoral health policy are discussed.},

@article{Johnston2003,
abstract = {Debate continues about the inter-relationships between human and physical
geography and their different research and publication practices.
Relatively little data about these are available, however. Using
an analysis of all publications submitted by UK geographers to the
2001 Research Assessment Exercise, this paper identifies a substantial
difference between human and physical geographers in their publication
strategies. Most physical geographers place their research papers
in specialized inter-disciplinary journals and make relatively little
use of geography outlets: most human geographers, on the other hand,
publish in geography journals. Comparisons with other disciplines
- in the earth and environmental and social sciences respectively
- also identify differences between geographers and their peers.
The overall conclusion is that, with regard to research and publication
at least, UK geography cannot be presented as a single academic community
with strong internal ties, but rather as a conglomerate of separate
communities writing for different audiences.},

@article{Grossmann2010,
abstract = {Several forms of renewable energy compete for supremacy or for an appropriate role in global energy supply. A form of renewable energy can only play an important role in global energy supply if it fulfills several basic requirements. Its capacity must allow supplying a considerable fraction of present and future energy demand, all materials for its production must be readily available, land demand must not be prohibitive, and prices must reach grid parity in the nearer future. Moreover, a renewable energy technology can only be acceptable if it is politically safe. We supply a collection of indicators which allow assessing competing forms of renewable energy and elucidate why surprise is still a major factor in this field, calling for adaptive management. Photovoltaics (PV) are used as an example of a renewable energy source that looks highly promising, possibly supplemented by solar thermal electricity production (ST). We also show why energy use will contribute to land use problems and discuss ways in which the right choice of renewables may be indispensible in solving these problems.},

abstract = {This paper explores a new approach to planning and optimization of
energy networks, using a mix of global optimization and agent-based
modeling tools. This approach takes account of techno-economic, environmental
and social criteria, and engages explicitly with inherent network
complexity in terms of the autonomous decision-making capability
of individual agents within the network, who may choose not to act
as economic rationalists. This is an important consideration from
the standpoint of meeting sustainable development goals. The approach
attempts to set targets for energy planning, by determining preferred
network development pathways through multi-objective optimization.
The viability of such plans is then explored through agent-based
models. The combined approach is demonstrated for a case study of
regional electricity generation in South Africa, with biomass as
feedstock.},

abstract = {Widespread evidence of a +4-6-m sea-level highstand during the last interglacial period (Marine Isotope Stage 5e) has led to warnings that modern ice sheets will deteriorate owing to global warming and initiate a rise of similar magnitude by ad 2100 (ref. 1). The rate of this projected rise is based on ice-sheet melting simulations and downplays discoveries of more rapid ice loss. Knowing the rate at which sea level reached its highstand during the last interglacial period is fundamental in assessing if such rapid ice-loss processes could lead to future catastrophic sea-level rise. The best direct record of sea level during this highstand comes from well-dated fossil reefs in stable areas. However, this record lacks both reef-crest development up to the full highstand elevation, as inferred from widespread intertidal indicators at +6 m, and a detailed chronology, owing to the difficulty of replicating U-series ages on submillennial timescales. Here we present a complete reef-crest sequence for the last interglacial highstand and its U-series chronology from the stable northeast Yucat\'{a}n peninsula, Mexico. We find that reef development during the highstand was punctuated by reef-crest demise at +3 m and back-stepping to +6 m. The abrupt demise of the lower-reef crest, but continuous accretion between the lower-lagoonal unit and the upper-reef crest, allows us to infer that this back-stepping occurred on an ecological timescale and was triggered by a 2-3-m jump in sea level. Using strictly reliable (230)Th ages of corals from the upper-reef crest, and improved stratigraphic screening of coral ages from other stable sites, we constrain this jump to have occurred approximately 121 kyr ago and conclude that it supports an episode of ice-sheet instability during the terminal phase of the last interglacial period.},

@article{Banister1997,
abstract = {Most people value and enjoy the benefits that the use of their own car brings to their quality of life. These benefits are reflected in the increases in travel, the use of more resources, and the production of more pollution. However, this situation is not sustainable. In this paper the author argues the case for planning playing an instrumental role in achieving sustainability objectives in transport. It reviews the contributions that economics (pricing) and technological measures might have. The conclusion reached is that the scale of price increases required to achieve a reduction in car use will not be politically acceptable. Similarly, technological improvements may only give us a breathing space before more positive action is necessary. Even if the environmental problems created by the car are solved, there will always be the underlying problem of congestion. The only alternative is to travel shorter distances, to develop the potential for linking activities, and to use the car less -- this is where planning has a key role.Three main actions are proposed to avoid the need to travel. The first is the implementation of a set of development principles through examining the role that density and settlement size might have on urban sustainability. This issue is particularly important given the current debate at all levels in the United Kingdom over housing allocations and the possibility of a new generation of new settlements. The second action explores the concept of the social audit and the social costs associated with the closure of existing facilities and the opening of new facilities, many of which are inaccessible to those without a car. There have been savings to the provider of the facility through economies of scale, but additional costs have been transferred to the users of these facilities. The social audit would examine all the costs and benefits of these decisions, with a view to subsidy to prevent closure and a tax on greenfield developments to help pay for the redevelopment of brownfield sites within urban areas. The third action is to create quality neighbourhoods in cities to maintain and promote communities with high enviromental quality and no congestion. It is only through maintaining and improving environmental quality that urban sustainability can be enhanced, as these locations must form the focus for development. They allow for the provision of clean public transport, they would promote walk and cycling, and they would reduce levels of car dependence.},

abstract = {Census data can be represented both as lists and as tabulations ofhousehold/individual attributes. List representation of Census data offers greater flexibility, as the exploration of interrelationships between population characteristics is limited only by the quality and scope of the data collected. Unfortunately, the released lists of household/individual attributes (Samples of Anonymised Records, SARs) are spatially referenced only to areas (single or merged districts) with populations of 120 000 or more, whereas released tabulations are available for units as small as single enumeration districts (Small Area Statistics, SAS). Intuitively, it should be possible to derive list-based estimates of enumeration district populations by combining information contained in the SAR and the SAS. In this paper we explore the range of solutions that could be adapted to this problem which, ultimately, is presented as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem. Various techniques of combinatorial optimisation are tested, and preliminary results from the best performing algorithm are evaluated. Through this process, the lack of suitable test statistics for the comparison of observed and expected tabulations of population data is highlighted.},

abstract = {We described three uses of energy for which greater efficiency is feasible: transportation, space heating, and air conditioning. Shifts to less energy-intensive transportation modes could substantially reduce energy consumption; the magnitude of such savings would, of course, depend on the extent of such shifts and possible load factor changes. The hypothetical transportation scenario described here results in a 22 percent savings in energy for transportation in 1970, a savings of 2800 trillion Btu. To the homeowner, increasing the amount of building insulation and, in some cases, adding storm windows would reduce energy consumption and provide monetary savings. If all homes in 1970 had the "economic optimum" amount of insulation, energy consumption for residential heating would have been 42 percent less than if the homes were insulated to meet the pre-1971 FHA standards, a savings of 3100 trillion Btu. Increased utilization of energy-efficient air conditioners and of building insulation would provide significant energy savings and help to reduce peak power demands during the summer. A 67 percent increase in energy efficiency for room air conditioners would have saved 15.8 billion kilowatt-hours in 1970. In conclusion, it is possible-from an engineering point of view-to effect considerable energy savings in the United States. Increases in the efficiency of energy use would provide desired end results with smaller energy inputs. Such measures will not reduce the level of energy consumption, but they could slow energy growth rates.},

The amounts of \&\#8220;proven\&\#8221; and potential fossil fuel reserves are uncertain and debated. Regardless of the true values, society has flexibility in the degree to which it chooses to exploit these reserves, especially unconventional fossil fuels and those located in extreme or pristine environments. If conventional oil production peaks within the next few decades, it may have a large effect on future atmospheric CO2 and climate change, depending upon subsequent energy choices. Assuming that proven oil and gas reserves do not greatly exceed estimates of the Energy Information Administration, and recent trends are toward lower estimates, we show that it is feasible to keep atmospheric CO2 from exceeding about 450 ppm by 2100, provided that emissions from coal, unconventional fossil fuels, and land use are constrained. Coal-fired power plants without sequestration must be phased out before midcentury to achieve this CO2 limit. It is also important to \&\#8220;stretch\&\#8221; conventional oil reserves via energy conservation and efficiency, thus averting strong pressures to extract liquid fuels from coal or unconventional fossil fuels while clean technologies are being developed for the era \&\#8220;beyond fossil fuels\&\#8221;. We argue that a rising price on carbon emissions is needed to discourage conversion of the vast fossil resources into usable reserves, and to keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling.},

Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes that require as input only information on the population distribution. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena affected by mobility and transport processes.},

of hydrogen technologies into the energy infrastructure is presented.
The question is asked, Should money and energy be spent on carbon

@book{Tilman1997,
abstract = {Spatial Ecology addresses the fundamental effects of space on the dynamics of individual species and on the structure, dynamics, diversity, and stability of multispecies communities. Although the ecological world is unavoidably spatial, there have been few attempts to determine how explicit considerations of space may alter the predictions of ecological models, or what insights it may give into the causes of broad-scale ecological patterns. As this book demonstrates, the spatial structure of a habitat can fundamentally alter both the qualitative and quantitative dynamics and outcomes of ecological processes.Spatial Ecology highlights the importance of space to five topical areas: stability, patterns of diversity, invasions, coexistence, and pattern generation. It illustrates both the diversity of approaches used to study spatial ecology and the underlying similarities of these approaches. Over twenty contributors address issues ranging from the persistence of endangered species, to the maintenance of biodiversity, to the dynamics of hosts and their parasitoids, to disease dynamics, multispecies competition, population genetics, and fundamental processes relevant to all these cases. There have been many recent advances in our understanding of the influence of spatially explicit processes on individual species and on multispecies communities. This book synthesizes these advances, shows the limitations of traditional, non-spatial approaches, and offers a variety of new approaches to spatial ecology that should stimulate ecological research.},

abstract = {The twenty thematic chapters in this book provide a broad set of perspectives on the plight, possibilities and opportunities of urban transport in the developing world, set against the challenges of sustainable development. The contributors expertly set the international context of transport policy-making and planning for developing cities and present a critical review of recent developments that have taken place and which offer lessons for the future.The special features that distinguish this book are: its multiple institutional perspectives on transport in the urban development of developing cities: its efforts to link sustainability with urban transport and other development concerns; and its understanding of the consequences of globalism in choices and obligations for urban transport.This Handbook will prove invaluable for professional practitioners and academics engaged in and concerned with the future of movement in cities of the developing world. It will also be of interest to students of urban transport and city planning, particularly those from developing countries. Politicians, policy-makers and international development agencies and investors, as well as those working for international non-government organizations wishing to familiarize themselves with the mounting transportation challenges of developing cities, will also find this book a source of inspiration.},

abstract = {The empirical evidence in the papers in this special issue identifies pervasive and difficult cross-scale and cross-level interactions in managing the environment. The complexity of these interactions and the fact that both scholarship and management have only recently begun to address this complexity have provided the impetus for us to present one synthesis of scale and cross-scale dynamics. In doing so, we draw from multiple cases, multiple disciplines, and multiple perspectives. In this synthesis paper, and in the accompanying cases, we hypothesize that the dynamics of cross-scale and cross-level interactions are affected by the interplay between institutions at multiple levels and scales. We suggest that the advent of co-management structures and conscious boundary management that includes knowledge co-production, mediation, translation, and negotiation across scale-related boundaries may facilitate solutions to complex problems that decision makers have historically been unable to solve.},

abstract = {Recently, analytical approaches based on the eigenfunctions of spatial configuration matrices have been proposed in order to consider explicitly spatial predictors. The present study demonstrates the usefulness of eigenfunctions in spatial modeling applied to ecological problems and shows equivalencies of and differences between the two current implementations of this methodology. The two approaches in this category are the distance-based (DB) eigenvector maps proposed by P. Legendre and his colleagues, and spatial filtering based upon geographic connectivity matrices (i.e., topology-based; CB) developed by D. A. Griffith and his colleagues. In both cases, the goal is to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into conventional regression models. One important advantage of these two approaches over any other spatial approach is that they provide a flexible tool that allows the full range of general and generalized linear modeling theory to be applied to ecological and geographical problems in the presence of nonzero spatial autocorrelation.},

@book{Warf2009,
abstract = {Across the disciplines, the study of space has undergone a profound and sustained transformation. Space, place, mapping, and geographical imaginations have become commonplace topics in a variety of analytical fields in part because globalization has accentuated the significance of location. While this transformation has led to a renaissance in human geography, it also has manifested itself in the humanities and other social sciences. The purpose of this book is not to announce that space is significant, which by now is well known, but to explore how space is analyzed by a variety of disciplines, to compare and contrast these approaches, identify commonalities, and explore how and why differences appear. The volume includes works by 13 scholars from a variety of geographical regions and disciplines. The chapters combine up-to-date literature reviews concerning the role of space in each discipline and several offer original empirical analyses. Some chapters are concerned with Geography while others explore the role of space in contemporary Anthropology, Sociology, Religion, Political Science, Film, and Cultural Studies. The introduction surveys the development of the spatial turn across the fields under consideration. Despite frequent reference to the spatial turn, this is the first volume to explicitly address how theory and practice concerning space, is used in a variety of fields from diverse conceptual perspectives. This book will appeal to everyone conducting conceptual and theoretical research on space, not simply in Geography, but in related fields as well.},

He outlines in detail the traditional American values that progressives hold, but are often unable to articulate. Lakoff also breaks down the ways conservatives have framed the issues, and provides examples of how progressives can reframe the debate.Lakoff's years of research and work with environmental and political leaders have been distilled into this essential guide, which shows progressives how to think in terms of values instead of programs, and why people vote their values and identities, often against their best interests.},

The combination was synergic against 16 isolates and additive/indifferent against 20. For 10 of the clinical isolates (two MSSA, three MRSA, two MSSE, three MRSE) and the reference strain, the interaction of cefepime and vancomycin was also determined by the time-kill method. Except for one MRSA isolate, synergic killing was demonstrated with clinically achievable concentrations of vancomycin (0.5-1 mg/L) and cefepime (methicillin-susceptible isolates: 0.5-1 mg/L; methicillin-resistant isolates: 2-64 mg/L).},

abstract = {Abstract Goal, Scope and Background\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The automotive industry has a long history in improving the environmental performance of vehicles - fuel economy and emission improvements, introduction of recycled and renewable materials, etc. The European Union also aims at improving the environmental performance of products by reducing, in particular, waste resulting from End-of-Life Vehicles (ELVs) for example. The European Commission estimates that ELVs contribute to approximately 1 \% of the total waste in Europe [9]. Other European Union strategies are considering more life cycle aspects, as well as other impacts including resource or climate change. This article is summarizing the results of a European Commission funded project (LIRECAR) that aims at identifying the environmental impacts and relevance for combinations of recycling / recovery and lightweight vehicle design options over the whole life cycle of a vehicle - i.e. manufacturing, use and recycling/recovery. Three, independent and scientific LCA experts reviewed the study according to ISO 14040. From the beginning, representatives of all Life Cycle Stakeholders have been involved (European materials \& supplier associations, an environmental Non-Governmental Organization, recycler’s association).},

abstract = {Samples used in social and commercial surveys, especially of the general population, are usually less random (often by design) than many people using them realise. Unless it is understood, this 'non-randomness' can compromise the conclusions drawn from the data. This book introduces the challenges posed by less-than-perfect samples, giving background knowledge and practical guidance for those who have to deal with them. It explains why samples are, and sometimes should be, non-random in the first place; how to assess the degree of non-randomness; when correction by weighting is appropriate and how to apply it; and how the statistical treatment of these samples must be adapted. Extended data examples show the techniques at work. This is a book for practising researchers. It is a reference for the methods and formulae needed to deal with commonly encountered situations and, above all, a source of realistic and implementable solutions.},

@book{Gilbert2008-abm,
abstract = {Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a technique increasingly used in a broad range of social sciences. It involves building a computational model consisting of “agents,” each of which represents an actor in the social world, and an "environment" in which the agents act. Agents are able to interact with each other and are programmed to be pro-active, autonomous and able to perceive their virtual world. The techniques of ABM are derived from artificial intelligence and computer science, but are now being developed independently in research centers throughout the world.In Agent-Based Models, Nigel Gilbert reviews a range of examples of agent-based modeling, describes how to design and build your own models, and considers practical issues such as verification, validation, planning a modeling project, and how to structure a scholarly article reporting the results of agent-based modeling. It includes a glossary, an annotated list of resources, advice on which programming environment to use when creating agent-based models, and a worked, step-by-step example of the development of an ABM.This latest volume in the SAGE Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences series will have wide appeal in the social sciences, including the disciplines of sociology, economics, social psychology, geography, economic history, science studies, and environmental studies. It is appropriate for graduate students, researchers and academics in these fields, for both those wanting to keep up with new developments in their fields and those who are considering using ABM for their research.Key FeaturesAimed at readers who are new to ABMOffers a brief, but thorough, treatment of a cutting-edge techniqueOffers practical advice about how to design and create ABMIncludes carefully chosen examples from different disciplines},

Interest in socialsimulation has been growing rapidly worldwideas a result of increasingly powerfulhardware capabilities and software programs.The focus on this area of expertiseis also influenced by a rising interest in theapplication of ideas of complexity, evolution,adaptation, and chaos in the socialsciences.This authoritative book details all of thecommon approaches to social simulation, toprovide social scientists with an appreciationof the literature and allow those with someprogramming skills to create their ownsimulations. New for this edition are achapter on how to use simulation as a tool,as well as a chapter on multi-agent systemsto explain why and how multi-agent modelinghas become the preferred approach tosimulation.},

abstract = {Electricity is perhaps the most versatile energy carrier in modern
economies, and it is therefore fundamentally linked to human and
economic development. Electricity growth has outpaced that of any
other fuel, leading to ever-increasing shares in the overall mix.
This trend is expected to continue throughout the following decades,
as large—especially rural—segments of the world population in developing
countries start to climb the “energy ladder” and become connected
to power grids. Electricity therefore deserves particular attention
with regard to its contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions,
which is reflected in the ongoing development of low-carbon technologies
for power generation. The focus of this updated review of electricity-generating
technologies is twofold: (a) to provide more technical information
than is usually found in global assessments on critical technical
aspects, such as variability of wind power, and (b) to capture the
most recent findings from the international literature. This report
covers eight technologies. Seven of these are generating technologies:
hydro-, nuclear, wind, photovoltaic, concentrating solar, geothermal
and biomass power. The remaining technology is carbon capture and
storage. This selection is fairly representative for technologies
that are important in terms of their potential capacity to contribute
to a low-carbon world economy.},

@article{Meinshausen2009,
abstract = {More than 100 countries have adopted a global warming limit of 2 degrees C or below (relative to pre-industrial levels) as a guiding principle for mitigation efforts to reduce climate change risks, impacts and damages. However, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions corresponding to a specified maximum warming are poorly known owing to uncertainties in the carbon cycle and the climate response. Here we provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying GHG emission budgets for the 2000-50 period that would limit warming throughout the twenty-first century to below 2 degrees C, based on a combination of published distributions of climate system properties and observational constraints. We show that, for the chosen class of emission scenarios, both cumulative emissions up to 2050 and emission levels in 2050 are robust indicators of the probability that twenty-first century warming will not exceed 2 degrees C relative to pre-industrial temperatures. Limiting cumulative CO(2) emissions over 2000-50 to 1,000 Gt CO(2) yields a 25\% probability of warming exceeding 2 degrees C-and a limit of 1,440 Gt CO(2) yields a 50\% probability-given a representative estimate of the distribution of climate system properties. As known 2000-06 CO(2) emissions were approximately 234 Gt CO(2), less than half the proven economically recoverable oil, gas and coal reserves can still be emitted up to 2050 to achieve such a goal. Recent G8 Communiqu\'{e}s envisage halved global GHG emissions by 2050, for which we estimate a 12-45\% probability of exceeding 2 degrees C-assuming 1990 as emission base year and a range of published climate sensitivity distributions. Emissions levels in 2020 are a less robust indicator, but for the scenarios considered, the probability of exceeding 2 degrees C rises to 53-87\% if global GHG emissions are still more than 25\% above 2000 levels in 2020.},

abstract = {This paper presents results of a study of projected costs for a grid-connected PV system for domestic application in Ireland. The study is based on results from a 1.72 kWp PV system installed on a flat rooftop in Dublin, Ireland. During its first year of operation a total of 885.1 kWh/kWp of electricity was generated with a performance ratio of 81.5\%. The scenarios employed in this study consider: a range of capital costs; cost dynamics based on a PV module learning rate of 20±5\%; projections for global annual installed PV capacity under an advanced and moderate market growth conditions; domestic electricity cost growth of 4.5\% based on historic data; and a reduction of 25\% or 50\% in the CO2 intensity of national electricity production by 2055. These scenarios are used to predict when system life cycle production costs fall to grid prices (grid parity). Average NPV and electricity generation costs ranged from −€14,330 and 0.58 €/kWh and were close to zero and 0.18 €/kWh for a system installed in 2009 and 2030, respectively. However, under optimistic conditions NPVs are positive for systems installed after 2021 and grid parity occurs in 2016. Findings are compared with similar international studies.},

These rises will almost certainly accelerate through the 21st century and beyond because of global warming, but their magnitude remains uncertain. Key uncertainties include the possible role of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets and the amplitude of regional changes in sea level. In many areas, nonclimatic components of relative sea-level change (mainly subsidence) can also be locally appreciable. Although the impacts of sea-level rise are potentially large, the application and success of adaptation are large uncertainties that require more assessment and consideration.},

@article{Ramanathan2005,
abstract = {Energy is consumed both by passenger and freight traffic, and it is
generally not possible to apportion energy consumption exclusively
to either of the traffic without making restrictive assumptions on
the energy consumption norms of vehicles. The use of data envelopment
analysis (DEA) has been suggested earlier in the literature for comparing
energy efficiencies without requiring any such restrictive assumptions.
In this paper, the applicability of DEA is further extended to estimate
energy consumption of rail and/or road transport that would result
in a pre-specified DEA efficiency. Using this new approach, effects
of capturing some modal split in favour of rail transport on future
energy consumption and emissions of carbon dioxide are presented
in the paper via a scenario analysis. It is shown that if rail could
capture 50\% modal share in the years 2005-2006 and 2020-2021, it
would save nearly 35\% energy consumption and emissions compared to
the situation when existing patterns of modal split are allowed to
continue without policy intervention.},

abstract = {As one of the most challenging issues facing the transport sector, the need for this handbook devoted to the environmental impacts of transport is clear. It gives full treatment to all aspects of the subject:- environmental concepts, both physical and economic- key environmental concerns: global warming, air quality, noise, safety, amenity, and severance- the role of fuel sources and new technology in reducing environmental externalities- the contribution of each transport sector to energy consumption and emissions - appraisal, valuation, and impacts of externalities- institutional and political settings and policies- the role of environmental legislation- special topics such as tourism, public attitudes, and genderEach chapter was specially commissioned from an acknowledged world expert on the topic. Each offers an overview and useful insights to those familiar with the area as well as those new to it. Systematic and thorough in its creation, current and acessible in its content, and authoritative and international in its authorship, the Handbook of Transport and the Environment will be the definitive reference work on this important subject.},

abstract = {The bicycle is almost unique among human-powered machines in that it uses human muscles in a near-optimum way. This new edition of the bible of bicycle builders and bicyclists provides just about everything you could want to know about the history of bicycles, how human beings propel them, what makes them go faster, and what keeps them from going even faster. The scientific and engineering information is of interest not only to designers and builders of bicycles and other human-powered vehicles but also to competitive cyclists, bicycle commuters, and recreational cyclists.The third edition begins with a brief history of bicycles and bicycling that demolishes many widespread myths. This edition includes information on recent experiments and achievements in human-powered transportation, including the "ultimate human- powered vehicle," in which a supine rider in a streamlined enclosure steers by looking at a television screen connected to a small camera in the nose, reaching speeds of around 80 miles per hour. It contains completely new chapters on aerodynamics, unusual human-powered machines for use on land and in water and air, human physiology, and the future of bicycling. This edition also provides updated information on rolling drag, transmission of power from rider to wheels, braking, heat management, steering and stability, power and speed, and materials. It contains many new illustrations.},

@article{Cox2008,
abstract = {The Amazon rainforest plays a crucial role in the climate system, helping to drive atmospheric circulations in the tropics by absorbing energy and recycling about half of the rainfall that falls on it. This region (Amazonia) is also estimated to contain about one-tenth of the total carbon stored in land ecosystems, and to account for one-tenth of global, net primary productivity. The resilience of the forest to the combined pressures of deforestation and global warming is therefore of great concern, especially as some general circulation models (GCMs) predict a severe drying of Amazonia in the twenty-first century. Here we analyse these climate projections with reference to the 2005 drought in western Amazonia, which was associated with unusually warm North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs). We show that reduction of dry-season (July-October) rainfall in western Amazonia correlates well with an index of the north-south SST gradient across the equatorial Atlantic (the 'Atlantic N-S gradient'). Our climate model is unusual among current GCMs in that it is able to reproduce this relationship and also the observed twentieth-century multidecadal variability in the Atlantic N-S gradient, provided that the effects of aerosols are included in the model. Simulations for the twenty-first century using the same model show a strong tendency for the SST conditions associated with the 2005 drought to become much more common, owing to continuing reductions in reflective aerosol pollution in the Northern Hemisphere.},

@book{Odum1996,
abstract = {In this important new work, Howard T. Odum, widely acknowledged as the father of systems ecology, lucidly explains his concept of emergy, a measure of real wealth that provides a rational, science-based method of evaluating commodities, services, and environmental goods. Using specific real-world examples, Dr. Odum clearly demonstrates the revolutionary role of emergy in environmental management and policy making. Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making offers environmental professionals--policymakers, managers, ecologists, planners, developers, and activists--a systematic approach to environmental and economic valuation that will eliminate much of the rancor and adversarial decision making that often plagues environmental issues. Specifically, this book:  * Describes the theoretical basis, calculation procedures, and applications of emergy  * Introduces the concept of "transformity," the ratio of emergy (work put into a product) and energy (value received from the product)  * Provides formulas for emergy calculations, procedures for making an emergy evaluation table, and parameters for updating evaluations  * Demonstrates the use of emergy to evaluate environments, minerals, waters, primary energy sources, economic developments, and international trade  * Compares the emergy approach to environmental evaluation with others Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making will help environmental decision makers and the society they serve maximize economic vitality with less trial and error, innovate with fewer failures, and adapt to change more rapidly. It provides the tools they need to arrive at the best policies in resource management, economics, and the environment. Balancing the economy and the environment-- from the father of systems ecology Increasing economic dependence on diminishing natural resources has sparked a highly charged debate over the use and fate of the world environment. Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making presents a unique method of environmental management based on maximizing real wealth, the whole economy, and the public benefit. Renowned ecologist Howard T. Odum introduces the concept of emergy to provide a rational alternative to the tug-of-war over the world's most vital assets. Emergy measures the energy put into making a product and is the cornerstone of Odum's revolutionary text. This timely and important book offers key insights into:  * Determining the real value of a product or service  * Transformity, or the relationship between emergy (input) and energy (output)  * Stored wealth, available energy, and the final product  * Balancing economic and environmental needs Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making will help economists, ecologists, policymakers, and planners make more responsible, informed decisions to sustain economic and environmental development.},

abstract = {This study presents the life cycle assessment (LCA) of three batteries for plug-in hybrid and full performance battery electric vehicles. A transparent life cycle inventory (LCI) was compiled in a component-wise manner for nickel metal hydride (NiMH), nickel cobalt manganese lithium-ion (NCM), and iron phosphate lithium-ion (LFP) batteries. The battery systems were investigated with a functional unit based on energy storage, and environmental impacts were analyzed using midpoint indicators. On a per-storage basis, the NiMH technology was found to have the highest environmental impact, followed by NCM and then LFP, for all categories considered except ozone depletion potential. We found higher life cycle global warming emissions than have been previously reported. Detailed contribution and structural path analyses allowed for the identification of the different processes and value-chains most directly responsible for these emissions. This article contributes a public and detailed inventory, which can be easily be adapted to any powertrain, along with readily usable environmental performance assessments.},

abstract = {The United Kingdom is committed to reducing its gas emissions by at least 80\% by 2050, a target that will only be achieved by transforming the way that energy is supplied and used. At the same time there are anxieties about the security of energy provision in terms of European dependency on natural gas and the reliability of electric supply. This book explores in detail those factors which could help or hinder the attainment of the UK's climate change targets, and how these factors interact with the parallel objective of maintaining a robust and secure energy system. The book is the result of a major national energy research effort by the UK Energy Research Center, which includes some of the UK's leading energy experts. The results and recommendations are essential reading for policymakers, professionals, researchers and anyone concerned with achieving large-scale reductions in carbon emissions, both from the UK and internationally.},

abstract = {As fuel prices continue to soar, more and more people are finding themselves unable to meet the basic costs of energy, and may be forced to choose between (for example) adequate food and adequate warmth ”they are in fuel poverty. It is a complex issue, and for years companies, governments and civil society have vigorously apportioned blame with little to show in the way of practical results. Since its publication in the early '90s, Brenda Boardman's Fuel Povertyhas been the keystone text for those wishing to learn about this controversial subject. In this, its successor, she turns a critical eye to the new millennium and finds that the situation, while now more widely recognized, is far from having improved. The book begins by discussing the political awakening to the issue and exploring just who constitutes the fuel poor, and how this has changed in recent decades. It examines the traditional and emerging drivers for the problem, and looks at and evaluates the policies that have been employed to help alleviate the problem. The latter part presents a detailed set of proposals based around long-term improvements in housing stock that must be employed if we are to avoid a seemingly inexorable slide in the face of political best intentions.},

abstract = {This joint report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) is the seventh in a series of studies on electricity generating costs.  It presents the latest data available for a wide variety of fuels and technologies, including coal and gas (with and without carbon capture), nuclear, hydro, onshore and offshore wind, biomass, solar, wave and tidal as well as combined heat and power (CHP).  It provides levelised costs of electricity (LCOE) per MWh for almost 200 plants, based on data covering 21 countries (including four major non-OECD countries), and several industrial companies and organisations.  For the first time, the report contains an extensive sensitivity analysis of the impact of variations in key parameters such as discount rates, fuel prices and carbon costs on LCOE.  Additional issues affecting power generation choices are also examined.  The study shows that the costs competitiveness of electricity generating technologies depends on a number of factors which may vary nationally and regionally. Readers will find full details and analyses, supported by over 130 figures and tables, in this report which is expected to constitute a valuable tool for decision makers and researchers concerned with energy policies and climate change.},

@article{Bergstrom2003a,
abstract = {In this Swedish study, the attitudes towards cycling during winter
in general, and in relation to winter maintenance of cycleways in
particular, is examined. Questionnaires were answered by a thousand
employees at four major companies in two Swedish cities. There was
a clear difference in mode choice between seasons. The number of
car trips increased by 27\% from summer to winter while the number
of bicycle trips decreased by 47\%. The number of car trips increased
with distance while the number of bicycle trips decreased, and the
decrease was even more significant in winter than in summer. There
was a difference in opinion between different categories of cyclists,
on what factors influenced the choice of transport mode for the journey
to work. Temperature, precipitation, and road condition were the
most important factors to those who cycled to work in summer but
not in winter. Exercise was the most important to those who cycled
frequently in winter, and travel time the most important to those
who never cycled to work. By improving winter maintenance service
levels on cycleways, it might be possible to increase the number
of bicycle trips during winter by 18\%, representing a corresponding
decrease in the number of car trips of 6\%. To increase cycling during
winter, snow clearance was found to be the most important maintenance
measure. Skid control was not considered as important for the choice
of mode, although important to attend to for safety reasons. (C)

I published the first note proposing H2 storage and transmission of energy phis use of fuel cells as the general solution to climate environmental decay in 1971, a full paper in 1972 and the first book in 1975. H2 would be used instead of natural gas in industry, particularly in metallurgical extractions and in the home. To extract H2 from water at 2020 would be 20\% more expensive than present gasoline — if one allows the pollutional costs of gasoline to be taken into account.},

abstract = {Transport Revolutions: Moving People and Freight without Oil sets out the challenges to our growing dependence on transport fuelled by low-priced oil. These challenges include an early peak in world oil production and profound climate change resulting in part from oil use. It proposes responses to ensure effective, secure movement of people and goods in ways that make the best use of renewable sources of energy while minimizing environmental impacts.Transport Revolutions synthesizes engineering, economics, environment, organization, policy and technology, and draws extensively on current data to present important conclusions. The authors argue that land transport in the first half of the 21st century will feature at least two revolutions. One will involve the use of electric drives rather than internal combustion engines. Another will involve powering many of these drives directly from the electric grid - as trains and trolley buses are powered today - rather than from on-board fuel. They go on to discuss marine transport, whose future is less clear, and aviation, which could see the most dramatic breaks from current practice.With its expert analysis of the politics and business of transport, Transport Revolutions is essential reading for professionals and students in transport, energy, town planning and public policy.},

abstract = {There are several established methodologies for generating synthetic populations. These include deterministic reweighting, conditional probability (Monte Carlo simulation) and simulated annealing. However, each of these approaches is limited by, for example, the level of geography to which it can be applied, or number of characteristics of the real population that can be replicated. The research examines and critiques the performance of each of these methods over varying spatial scales. Results show that the most consistent and accurate populations generated over all the spatial scales are produced from the simulated annealing algorithm. The relative merits and limitations of each method are evaluated in the discussion.},

Responding to this demand, The SAGE Handbook of Spatial Analysis is a comprehensive and authoritative discussion of issues and techniques in the field of spatial data analysis. Its principal focus is on: Why the analysis of spatial data needs separate treatment The main areas of spatial analysis The key debates within spatial analysis Examples of the application of various spatial analytical techniques Problems in spatial analysis Areas for future research Aimed at an international audience of academics, The SAGE Handbook of Spatial Analysis will also prove essential to graduate level students and researchers in government agencies and the private sector.},

@book{Ortuzar2001,
abstract = {Transport planning, infrastructure project evaluation and policy making, particularly at the urban level, continue to be important issues in the 21st century. Transport modelling requires mathematical techniques in order to make predictions, which can then be utilised in planning and design. This is the basis for improved decision-making and planning in the transport arena. Building on the tremendous success of the previous editions, the new Modelling Transport continues to be the state of the art text in its field. As before, this third edition provides comprehensive and rigorous information and guidance, enabling readers to make practical use of every available technique. Presenting the following features: * A substantially updated section on data collection techniques * An examination of the latest topical modelling approaches, including new material on Probit Model estimation (now possible in practice) and Mixed Logit specification and estimation * New treatment of joint time-of-travel and assignment modelling * Significant new material on Stated Preferences * Added coverage of travel time valuation and, importantly, of the valuation of externalities such as accidents and environmental effects This book is the leader in its subject area, and gives the reader a unique contemporary account of key transport modelling techniques and applications. As before, each subject is approached as a modelling exercise with discussion of the roles of theory, data, model specification, estimation, validation and application. Techniques are included for selecting the right level of analysis and detail for modelling purposes, as well as how to adapt existing tools to serve the needs of regular updating of models and plans. Graduate and postgraduate students in transport engineering and planning, practicing transport engineers, consultants, planners and professional societies, as well as government agencies and district and city councils will find this an essential and valuable text.},

@article{Strachan2011,
abstract = {Aiming to lead amongst other G20 countries, the UK government has classified the twin energy policy priorities of decarbonisation and security of supply as a “centennial challenge”. This viewpoint discusses the UK's capacity for energy modelling and scenario building as a critical underpinning of iterative decision making to meet these policy ambitions. From a nadir, over the last decade UK modelling expertise has been steadily built up. However extreme challenges remain in the level and consistency of funding of core model teams — critical to ensure a full scope of energy model types and hence insights, and in developing new state-of-the-art models to address evolving uncertainties. Meeting this challenge will facilitate a broad scope of types and geographical scale of UK's analytical tools to responsively deliver the evidence base for a range of public and private sector decision makers, and ensure that the UK contributes to global efforts to advance the field of energy-economic modelling.},

@book{Murray2006,
abstract = {Praise for this edition: "This book has filled a huge gap in the market...Using wonderful examples, this book will not only help students build up a writer's "toolbox", but will also build confidence and empower thesis writers." Professor William J. Kerr, Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry, WestCHEM,University of Strathclyde Praise for the previous edition: "Rowena Murray's down to earth approach both recognises and relieves some of the agony pf writing a PhD. The advice in this book is both practical and motivational; sometimes it's "PhD-saving" too." Dr Christine Sinclair, Lecturer in the Centre for Academic Practice and Learning Enhancement at the University of StrathclydeHow to Write a Thesisprovides a down-to-earth guide to help students shape their theses. It offers valuable advice as well as practical tips and techniques, incorporating useful boxed summaries and checklists to help students stay on track or regain their way. The book is the culmination of many years of work with postgraduates and academics and covers all aspects of the research, writing and editing involved in the process of successfully completing a thesis.In this book, the author moves beyond the basics of thesis writing, introducing practical writing techniques such as freewriting, generative writing and binge writing. This edition now deals with the range of different doctorates on offer and integrates more examples of thesis writing. Building on the success of the evidence-based approach used in the first edition, there is also new coverage of Masters theses and undergraduate research projects, along with outlines of useful generic structures for social science and humanities projects.How to Write a Thesisis the most grounded guide available to students on the practicalities surrounding thesis writing and should be recommended reading for, and by, all supervisors.},

@article{Beddoe2009,
abstract = {A high and sustainable quality of life is a central goal for humanity.
Our current socio-ecological regime and its set of interconnected
worldviews, institutions, and technologies all support the goal of
unlimited growth of material production and consumption as a proxy
for quality of life. However, abundant evidence shows that, beyond
a certain threshold, further material growth no longer significantly
contributes to improvement in quality of life. Not only does further
material growth not meet humanity's central goal, there is mounting
evidence that it creates significant roadblocks to sustainability
through increasing resource constraints (i.e., peak oil, water limitations)
and sink constraints (i.e., climate disruption). Overcoming these
roadblocks and creating a sustainable and desirable future will require
an integrated, systems level redesign of our socio-ecological regime
focused explicitly and directly on the goal of sustainable quality
of life rather than the proxy of unlimited material growth. This
transition, like all cultural transitions, will occur through an
evolutionary process, but one that we, to a certain extent, can control
and direct. We suggest an integrated set of worldviews, institutions,
and technologies to stimulate and seed this evolutionary redesign
of the current socio-ecological regime to achieve global sustainability.},

abstract = {Wind power has a significant contribution to make in efforts to abate CO2 emissions from global energy systems. Currently, wind power generation costs are approaching parity with costs attributed to conventional, carbon-based sources of energy but the economic advantage still rests decidedly with conventional sources. Therefore, there is an imperative to ensure that wind power projects are developed in the most economically optimal fashion. For wind power project developers, shaving a few tenths of a cent off of the kilowatts per hour cost of wind power can mean the difference between a commercially viable project and a non-starter. For civic authorities who are responsible for managing municipally supported wind power projects, optimizing the economics of such projects can attenuate stakeholder opposition. This paper attempts to contribute to a better understanding of how to economically optimise wind power projects by conflating research from the fields of energy economics, wind power engineering, aerodynamics, geography and climate science to identify critical factors that influence the economic optimization of wind power projects.},

to make use of emission factors. However, such factors are not used

such activities for a large number of individuals. When compared

abstract = {Scientific communication relies on evidence that cannot be entirely included in publications, but the rise of computational science has added a new layer of inaccessibility. Although it is now accepted that data should be made available on request, the current regulations regarding the availability of software are inconsistent. We argue that, with some exceptions, anything less than the release of source programs is intolerable for results that depend on computation. The vagaries of hardware, software and natural language will always ensure that exact reproducibility remains uncertain, but withholding code increases the chances that efforts to reproduce results will fail.},

abstract = {Objectives To assess what interventions are effective in promoting
a population shift from using cars towards walking and cycling and
to assess the health effects of such interventions. Data sources
Published and unpublished reports in any language identified from
electronic databases, bibliographies, websites, and reference lists.
Review methods Systematic search and appraisal to identify experimental
or observational studies with a prospective or controlled retrospective
design that evaluated any intervention applied to an urban population
or area by measuring outcomes in members of the local population.
Results 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. We found some evidence
that targeted behaviour change programmes can change the behaviour
of motivated subgroups, resulting (in the largest study) in a shift
of around 5\% of all trips at a population level. Single studies of
commuter subsidies and a new railway station also showed positive
effects. The balance of best available evidence about publicity campaigns,
engineering measures, and other interventions suggests that they
have not been effective. Participants in trials of active commuting
experienced short term improvements in certain measures of health
and fitness, but we found no good evidence on effects on health of
any effective intervention at population level. Conclusions The best
available evidence of effectiveness in promoting a modal shift is
for targeted behaviour change programmes, but the social distribution
of their effects is unclear and some other types of intervention
have yet to be rigorously evaluated.},

abstract = {The influence of commuting in socio-economic dynamics increases constantly. Analysing and modelling the networks formed by commuters to help decision-making regarding the land-use has become crucial. This paper presents a simple spatial interaction simulated model with only one parameter. The proposed algorithm considers each individual who wants to commute, starting from their living place to all their workplaces. It decides where the location of the workplace following the classical rule inspired from the gravity law consisting in a compromise between the job offers and the distance to the jobs. The further away the job offer is, the more important it must be in order to be considered. Inversely, only the quantity of offers is important for the decision when these offers are close. The paper also presents a comparative analysis of the structure of the commuting networks of the four European regions to which we apply our model. The model is calibrated and validated on these regions. Results from the analysis shows that the model is very efficient in reproducing most of the statistical properties of the network given by the data sources.},

@book{Nakicenovic2000,
abstract = {Preface: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established jointly by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess periodically the science, impacts, and socio-economics of climate change and of adaptation and mitigation options. The IPCC provides, on request, scientific and technical advice to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its bodies. In response to a 1994 evaluation of the earlier IPCC IS92 emissions scenarios, the 1996 Plenary of the IPCC requested this Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (see Appendix I for the Terms of Reference). This report was accepted by the Working Group III (WGIII) plenary session in March 2000. The long-term nature and uncertainty of climate change and its driving forces require scenarios that extend to the end of the 21st century. This report describes the new scenarios and how they were developed. The SRES scenarios cover a wide range of the main driving forces of future emissions, from demographic to technological and economic developments. As required by the Terms of Reference, none of the scenarios in the set includes any future policies that explicitly address climate change, although all scenarios necessarily encompass various policies of other types. The set of SRES emissions scenarios is based on an extensive assessment of the literature, six alternative modelling approaches, and an "open process" that solicited wide participation and feedback from many groups and individuals. The SRES scenarios include the range of emissions of all relevant species of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and sulfur and their driving forces. The SRES writing team included more than 50 members from 18 countries who represent a broad range of scientific disciplines, regional backgrounds, and non-governmental organizations (see Appendix II). The team, led by Nebojsa Nakicenovic of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria, included representatives of six scenario modeling groups and lead authors from all three earlier IPCC scenario activities - the 1990 and 1992 scenarios and the 1994 scenario evaluation. The SRES preparation included six major steps: analysis of existing scenarios in the literature; analysis of major scenario characteristics, driving forces, and their relationships; formulation of four narrative scenario "storylines" to describe alternative futures; quantification of each storyline using a variety of modelling approaches; an "open" review process of the resultant emission scenarios and their assumptions; and three revisions of the scenarios and the report subsequent to the open review process, i.e., the formal IPCC Expert Review and the final combined IPCC Expert and Government Review. As required by the Terms of Reference, the SRES preparation process was open with no single "official" model and no exclusive "expert teams." To this end, in 1997 the IPCC advertised in relevant scientific journals and other publications to solicit wide participation in the process. A web site documenting the SRES process and intermediate results was created to facilitate outside input. Members of the writing team also published much of their background research in the peer-reviewed literature and on web sites. In June 1998, the IPCC Bureau agreed to make the unapproved, preliminary scenarios available to climate modelers, who could use the scenarios as a basis for the assessment of climatic changes in time for consideration in the IPCC's Third Assessment Report. We recommend that the new scenarios be used not only in the IPCC's future assessments of climate change, its impacts, and adaptation and mitigation options, but also as the basis for analyses by the wider research and policy community of climate change and other environmental problems.},

Reliance on the use of conventional aggregate data sources combined with the British Government's reluctance to make available microdata in the form of a public-use data set has restricted the type of questions analysts have been able to ask. The application of a methodology for generating synthetic microdata from a number of different aggregate sources is reported. The resultant information system can be used in a flexible manner to product distributions not currently available from aggregate sources. Additionally, the microdata form direct inputs into microsimulation models. The application described has been undertaken with Leeds Metropolitan District as the system of interest and a wide range of outputs is produced to illustrate the method.},

abstract = {We measured the metabolic cost (C) and mechanical work of riding historic bicycles at different speeds: these bicycles included the Hobby Horse (1820s), the Boneshaker (1860s), the High Wheeler (1870s), the Rover (1880s), the Safety (1890s) and a modern bicycle (1980s) as a mean of comparison. The rolling resistance and air resistance of each vehicle were assessed. The mechanical internal work (W(INT)) was measured from three-dimensional motion analysis of the Hobby Horse and modern bicycle moving on a treadmill at different speeds. The equation obtained from the modern bicycle data was applied to the other vehicles. We found the following results. (i) Apart from the Rover, which was introduced for safety reasons, every newly invented bicycle improved metabolic economy. (ii) The rolling resistance decreased with subsequent designs while the frontal area and, hence, aerodynamic drag was fairly constant (except for the High Wheeler). (iii) The saddle-assisted body weight relief (which was inaugurated by the Hobby Horse) was responsible for most of the reduction in metabolic cost compared with walking or running. Further reductions in C were due to decreases in stride/pedalling frequency and, hence, W(INT) at the same speeds. (iv) The introduction of gear ratios allowed the use of pedalling frequencies that optimize the power/contraction velocity properties of the propulsive muscles. As a consequence, net mechanical efficiency (the ratio between the total mechanical work and C) was almost constant (0.273 +/- 0.015s.d.) for all bicycle designs, despite the increase in cruising speed. In the period from 1820 to 1890, improved design of bicycles increased the metabolically equivalent speed by threefold compared with walking at an average pace of ca. + 0.5 ms(-1) per decade [corrected]. The speed gain was the result of concurrent technological advancements in wheeled, human-powered vehicles and of 'smart' adaptation of the same actuator (the muscle) to different operational conditions.},

abstract = {In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller,Limits to Growththe first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001. Meadows newly released manuscript,Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institutes Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the worldwar, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradationare essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent,Thinking in Systemshelps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.},

Yetto date, the few books that address the subject have been either too narrowlyfocused on specific aspects of spatial analysis, or written at a level ofteninaccessible to those lacking a strong background in Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data is the firstaccessible, self-contained treatment of hierarchical methods, modeling, anddata analysis for spatial and spatio-temporal data. Starting with overviews ofthe types of spatial data, the data analysis tools appropriate for each, and abrief review of the Bayesian approach to statistics, the authors discusshierarchical modeling for univariate spatial response data, including Bayesiankriging and lattice (areal data) modeling. They then consider the problem ofspatially misaligned data, methods for handling multivariate spatialresponses, spatio-temporal models, and spatial survival models. The finalchapter explores a variety of special topics, including spatially varyingcoefficient models.This book provides clear explanations, plentifulillustrations -some in full color-a variety of homework problems, andtutorials and worked examples using some of the field's most popular softwarepackages.. Written by a team of leaders in the field, it will undoubtedlyremain the primary textbook and reference on the subject for years to come.},

@book{Bryman2008,
abstract = {Now in a vivid full-color format, the third edition of Social Research Methods provides students with a uniquely straightforward explanation of the central approaches and techniques in social research methods. Integrating theory with practice, author Alan Bryman demonstrates the contexts in which different research methods are used and also shows how they should be implemented. In clear, student-friendly language, Bryman covers both qualitative and quantitative research methods--and the differences between them--as well as mixed-methods research, a subject on which he is an authority. Avoiding complicated mathematical formulas, he takes a non-technical approach to the range of tools available for the analysis of quantitative data. This approach provides students with a clear guide for creating their own research projects, choosing a method of analysis, interpreting their findings, and writing up their research. Thoroughly revised and updated in this third edition, Social Research Methods features exciting new boxed material, including helpful "Research in Focus" boxes that put real-life research in perspective; reinforcing "Key Concepts" boxes that provide definitions of new terms; handy "Tips and Skills" boxes offering practical advice; and finally, engaging "Thinking Deeper" boxes, which introduce discussion topics and debates on the complexities of social research methods. The text also includes several brand-new chapters. Offering an insightful perspective on the nature of social research and a practical guide to doing it, Social Research Methods, Third Edition, is an ideal text for both undergraduate and graduate courses in social research methods. New to this Edition New boxed material, including actual student experiences that detail the practices and problems social science students may encounter in the research process A brand new chapter, "The Literature Review," which introduces the main steps in beginning a research project and conducting a critical review of literature A revised chapter, "Planning a Research Project and Formulating Research Questions," which takes students through the research process and offers advice on how to best manage it Fully updated material on using the internet as a source of data and a medium for conducting research New screen-shots and step-by-step instructions for the latest versions of SPSS and NVivo, which help students analyze quantitative and qualitative data Supplements A Companion Website for both students and instructors. For instructors, the website offers a test bank, PowerPoint slides, notes to accompany the slides, and case studies with questions. For students, the site provides instant feedback multiple-choice questions, web links, an online research guide, interactive Excel tutorials, an interactive project guide, and accounts of real-life student research experiences.},

abstract = {A high and sustainable quality of life is a central goal for humanity.
Our current socio-ecological regime and its set of interconnected
worldviews, institutions, and technologies all support the goal of
unlimited growth of material production and consumption as a proxy
for quality of life. However, abundant evidence shows that, beyond
a certain threshold, further material growth no longer significantly
contributes to improvement in quality of life. Not only does further
material growth not meet humanity's central goal, there is mounting
evidence that it creates significant roadblocks to sustainability
through increasing resource constraints (i.e., peak oil, water limitations)
and sink constraints (i.e., climate disruption). Overcoming these
roadblocks and creating a sustainable and desirable future will require
an integrated, systems level redesign of our socio-ecological regime
focused explicitly and directly on the goal of sustainable quality
of life rather than the proxy of unlimited material growth. This
transition, like all cultural transitions, will occur through an
evolutionary process, but one that we, to a certain extent, can control
and direct. We suggest an integrated set of worldviews, institutions,
and technologies to stimulate and seed this evolutionary redesign
of the current socio-ecological regime to achieve global sustainability.},

abstract = {Census data can be represented both as lists and as tabulations ofhousehold/individual attributes. List representation of Census data offers greater flexibility, as the exploration of interrelationships between population characteristics is limited only by the quality and scope of the data collected. Unfortunately, the released lists of household/individual attributes (Samples of Anonymised Records, SARs) are spatially referenced only to areas (single or merged districts) with populations of 120 000 or more, whereas released tabulations are available for units as small as single enumeration districts (Small Area Statistics, SAS). Intuitively, it should be possible to derive list-based estimates of enumeration district populations by combining information contained in the SAR and the SAS. In this paper we explore the range of solutions that could be adapted to this problem which, ultimately, is presented as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem. Various techniques of combinatorial optimisation are tested, and preliminary results from the best performing algorithm are evaluated. Through this process, the lack of suitable test statistics for the comparison of observed and expected tabulations of population data is highlighted.},

abstract = {Objectives To assess what interventions are effective in promoting
a population shift from using cars towards walking and cycling and
to assess the health effects of such interventions. Data sources
Published and unpublished reports in any language identified from
electronic databases, bibliographies, websites, and reference lists.
Review methods Systematic search and appraisal to identify experimental
or observational studies with a prospective or controlled retrospective
design that evaluated any intervention applied to an urban population
or area by measuring outcomes in members of the local population.
Results 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. We found some evidence
that targeted behaviour change programmes can change the behaviour
of motivated subgroups, resulting (in the largest study) in a shift
of around 5\% of all trips at a population level. Single studies of
commuter subsidies and a new railway station also showed positive
effects. The balance of best available evidence about publicity campaigns,
engineering measures, and other interventions suggests that they
have not been effective. Participants in trials of active commuting
experienced short term improvements in certain measures of health
and fitness, but we found no good evidence on effects on health of
any effective intervention at population level. Conclusions The best
available evidence of effectiveness in promoting a modal shift is
for targeted behaviour change programmes, but the social distribution
of their effects is unclear and some other types of intervention
have yet to be rigorously evaluated.},

abstract = {We present a "Bicycle Highway" transportation alternative to automobile
commuting by exploring avenues for reducing perceived impediments
to bicycle commuting. The three primary goals of the project are:
1) Address the American diabetes and obesity epidemics by making
exercising on a daily basis a more desirable and viable alternative.
2) Address the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants
by partially replacing combustion engines with human-powered transportation.
3) Address the problem of the United States' dependence on foreign
oil by diminishing energy demand for short-range transportation.
The primary variables we will consider are N, the number of people
being transported, d, the distance being traveled, C, the energy
cost required to travel the distance, and t, the time required to
travel the distance. The Bicycle Highway was found to have a poorer
throughput rating when only construction costs were considered, but
a better throughput rating when vehicle and fuel costs are introduced.
The Bicycle Highway offers a timely and economical solution to the
numerous side-effects of the century-long success of the gasoline-powered
automobile. A transportation corridor that is designated solely for
bicyclists, human-electric hybrid and zero-emission vehicles, would
allow for a greater volume of commuter traffic with minimal energetic
and entropic impact. This proposed roadway promises to make bicycle
travel much safer and will alleviate frustration felt by motorists
sharing the road with bicycles. We expect cost-effectiveness of our
design to be enhanced further if reductions in obesity, asthma, and
lung-disease related costs are considered in future case studies.},

abstract = {In this Swedish study, the attitudes towards cycling during winter
in general, and in relation to winter maintenance of cycleways in
particular, is examined. Questionnaires were answered by a thousand
employees at four major companies in two Swedish cities. There was
a clear difference in mode choice between seasons. The number of
car trips increased by 27\% from summer to winter while the number
of bicycle trips decreased by 47\%. The number of car trips increased
with distance while the number of bicycle trips decreased, and the
decrease was even more significant in winter than in summer. There
was a difference in opinion between different categories of cyclists,
on what factors influenced the choice of transport mode for the journey
to work. Temperature, precipitation, and road condition were the
most important factors to those who cycled to work in summer but
not in winter. Exercise was the most important to those who cycled
frequently in winter, and travel time the most important to those
who never cycled to work. By improving winter maintenance service
levels on cycleways, it might be possible to increase the number
of bicycle trips during winter by 18\%, representing a corresponding
decrease in the number of car trips of 6\%. To increase cycling during
winter, snow clearance was found to be the most important maintenance
measure. Skid control was not considered as important for the choice
of mode, although important to attend to for safety reasons. (C)

abstract = {Energy is consumed both by passenger and freight traffic, and it is
generally not possible to apportion energy consumption exclusively
to either of the traffic without making restrictive assumptions on
the energy consumption norms of vehicles. The use of data envelopment
analysis (DEA) has been suggested earlier in the literature for comparing
energy efficiencies without requiring any such restrictive assumptions.
In this paper, the applicability of DEA is further extended to estimate
energy consumption of rail and/or road transport that would result
in a pre-specified DEA efficiency. Using this new approach, effects
of capturing some modal split in favour of rail transport on future
energy consumption and emissions of carbon dioxide are presented
in the paper via a scenario analysis. It is shown that if rail could
capture 50\% modal share in the years 2005-2006 and 2020-2021, it
would save nearly 35\% energy consumption and emissions compared to
the situation when existing patterns of modal split are allowed to
continue without policy intervention.},

@article{Woodcock2007,
abstract = {We examine the links between fossil-fuel-based transportation, greenhouse-gas emissions, and health. Transport-related carbon emissions are rising and there is increasing consensus that the growth in motorised land vehicles and aviation is incompatible with averting serious climate change. The energy intensity of land transport correlates with its adverse health effects. Adverse health effects occur through climate change, road-traffic injuries, physical inactivity, urban air pollution, energy-related conflict, and environmental degradation. For the world's poor people, walking is the main mode of transport, but such populations often experience the most from the harms of energy-intensive transport. New energy sources and improvements in vehicle design and in information technology are necessary but not sufficient to reduce transport-related carbon emissions without accompanying behavioural change. By contrast, active transport has the potential to improve health and equity, and reduce emissions. Cities require safe and pleasant environments for active transport with destinations in easy reach and, for longer journeys, public transport that is powered by renewable energy, thus providing high levels of accessibility without car use. Much investment in major road projects does not meet the transport needs of poor people, especially women whose trips are primarily local and off road. Sustainable development is better promoted through improving walking and cycling infrastructures, increasing access to cycles, and investment in transport services for essential needs. Our model of London shows how increased active transport could help achieve substantial reductions in emissions by 2030 while improving population health. There exists the potential for a global contraction and convergence in use of fossil-fuel energy for transport to benefit health and achieve sustainability.},

The European Commission estimates that ELVs contribute to approximately 1 \% of the total waste in Europe [9]. Other European Union strategies are considering more life cycle aspects, as well as other impacts including resource or climate change. This article is summarizing the results of a European Commission funded project (LIRECAR) that aims at identifying the environmental impacts and relevance for combinations of recycling / recovery and lightweight vehicle design options over the whole life cycle of a vehicle - i.e. manufacturing, use and recycling/recovery. Three, independent and scientific LCA experts reviewed the study according to ISO 14040. From the beginning, representatives of all Life Cycle Stakeholders have been involved (European materials \& supplier associations, an environmental Non-Governmental Organization, recycler’s association).},

abstract = {Increased cycling as a means of personal travel could generate environmental
benefits if associated with a corresponding decrease in car-based
transport. For promoting cycling during winter, the maintenance service
level of cycleways is of importance. Earlier studies indicated that
the Swedish public is unsatisfied with the service levels provided
on cycleways during winter. In Sweden, cycleways normally are cleared
of snow through plowing and are gritted for skid control. Field studies
tested an unconventional winter maintenance method that uses a power
broom for snow clearance and salt for deicing. The field studies
were evaluated through road-condition observations, measurements
of friction, a questionnaire survey, interviews, and bicycle measurements.
The method of using a power. broom for snow clearance and salt for
deicing provided a higher service level than traditional winter maintenance
methods, but it was two to three times more expensive. The method
has greater potential in regions, such as southern Sweden, with low
snow accumulations but with major ice-formation problems than in
regions with a colder climate. Cyclists noticed. the improved maintenance
service level provided with the method used in the field study, but
although cyclists stated that road condition is important to their
decision to cycle, it could not be concluded that the enhanced service
level generated a higher winter cycling frequency.},

@article{Edwards2009,
abstract = {Obesogenic environments are a major explanation for the rapidly increasing prevalence in obesity. Investigating the relationship between obesity and obesogenic variables at the micro-level will increase our understanding about local differences in risk factors for obesity. SimObesity is a spatial microsimulation model designed to create micro-level estimates of obesogenic environment variables in the city of Leeds in the UK: consisting of a plethora of health, environment, and socio-economic variables. It combines individual micro-data from two national surveys with a coarse geography, with geographically finer scaled data from the 2001 UK Census, using a reweighting deterministic algorithm. This creates a synthetic population of individuals/households in Leeds with attributes from both the survey and census datasets. Logistic regression analyses identify suitable constraint variables to use. The model is validated using linear regression and equal variance t-tests. Height, weight, age, gender, and residential postcode data were collected on children aged 3-13 years in the Leeds metropolitan area, and obesity described as above the 98th centile for the British reference dataset. Geographically weighted regression is used to investigate the relationship between different obesogenic environments and childhood obesity. Validation shows that the small-area estimates were robust. The different obesogenic environments, as well as the parameter estimates from the corresponding local regression analyses, are mapped, all of which demonstrate non-stationary relationships. These results show that social capital and poverty are strongly associated with childhood obesity. This paper demonstrates a methodology to estimate health variables at the small-area level. The key to this technique is the choice of the model's input variables, which must be predictors for the output variables; this factor has not been stressed in other spatial microsimulation work. It also provides further evidence for the existence of obesogenic environments for children.},
